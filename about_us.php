				<h3><a style="color:#800080;">Some basic facts about us:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I had spent years denying how I have been creatively made.</li><br>

					<li>Once I embraced the beauty and joy of creating just for me I saw the impact that honoring my gifts also had on those around me.</li><br>

					<li>Living creatively and using our gifts can look different for each of us. Often times we can deny our gifts and make excuses for not living out our creativity.</li><br>

					<li>When we honor our gifts, creativity and passions it not only makes our lives more beautiful but it spills over into the lives of everyone around us.</li><br>

					<li>You see…it was never just about us.</li><br>

					<li>Imagine the impact we would have on our world if we started honoring the sacred parts of who we are and how we have been made.</li><br>

					<li>This community was born out of our desire to gather creatives of all kinds.</li><br>

					<li>We wanted to create a beautiful and inspiring space where we can come together but also provide easily accessible and affordable online workshops. A place where there would be no more excuses.</li><br>

					<li>This gathering place is for art and lifestyle workshops no matter your experience level.</li><br>

					<li>Let’s give ourselves the permission to be amateurs and the gift of practice.</li><br>

					<li>Being a creative person and living a creative life has far less to do with perfect art and more with being present and showing up.</li><br>

					<li>Let’s start where we are, with what we have and make the whole world our studio.</li><br>
